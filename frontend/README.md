# How It's Made

1. Spin up the Vite project.

```shell
npm create vite@latest
```

2. Name the project `frontend` when prompted, and select Javascript. 

3. Install axios in the new project. Axios lets us make HTTP requests from the React app. `modern-css-reset` is a CSS reset library that makes styling easier.

```shell
cd frontend
npm install axios
npm install modern-css-reset
```

4. Create a new component called `RedditForm.jsx`

5. Modify `App.jsx` to make the app load `RedditForm`.
